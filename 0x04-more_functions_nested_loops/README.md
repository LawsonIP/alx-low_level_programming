# C Programming - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of functions and nested loops in C programming. Each task in this project corresponds to a specific C program.

## Task 0: isupper

This program defines a function `_isupper` that checks if a character is uppercase.

## Task 1: isdigit

This program defines a function `_isdigit` that checks if a character is a digit.

## Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication

This program defines a function `mul` that multiplies two integers.

## Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves

This program defines a function `print_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.

## Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs

This program defines a function `print_most_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 but excludes 2 and 4.

## Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language

This program defines a function `more_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.

## Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

This program defines a function `print_line` that prints a straight line with a given length.

## Task 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

This program defines a function `print_diagonal` that prints a diagonal line with a given length.

## Task 8: You are so much sunshine in every square inch

This program defines a function `print_square` that prints a square of a given size.

## Task 9: Fizz-Buzz

This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100 but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

## Task 10: Triangles

This program defines a function `print_triangle` that prints a triangle of a given size.

## Task 11: The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers...

This program finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.

## Task 12: Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

This program defines a function `print_number` that prints an integer.

Each task is contained in a separate C source file with its respective test program.

## Usage

Compile each task's C source file with the provided test program to test the functionality. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isupper
