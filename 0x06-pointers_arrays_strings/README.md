# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings Project

This project includes C programs and functions related to pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C. Each file serves a specific purpose to help you learn about low-level programming concepts.

**0-strcat.c** - Concatenates two strings.

**1-strncat.c** - Concatenates two strings using at most `n` bytes from the source string.

**2-strncpy.c** - Copies a string up to `n` bytes.

**3-strcmp.c** - Compares two strings.

**4-rev_array.c** - Reverses the content of an array of integers.

**5-string_toupper.c** - Changes all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

**6-cap_string.c** - Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

**7-leet.c** - Encodes a string into 1337 (leet) language.

You can find the usage and details of each function within the respective code files.
