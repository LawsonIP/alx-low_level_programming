# Project: Debugging

## Description

This project contains multiple tasks that involve debugging existing code. Each task aims to identify and fix issues in the given code to make it work correctly. The tasks cover various aspects of C programming, such as debugging infinite loops, fixing logic errors, and ensuring proper date calculations, especially with leap years.

## Task 0: Multiple mains

### Description

In this task, you are provided with a main file that tests the `positive_or_negative` function. Your job is to create a new file named `0-main.c` that tests the function for a specific case, where the input is 0. You need to make sure that the function correctly handles this case and prints the expected output.

### Files

- `0-main.c`: A new main file that tests the `positive_or_negative` function.

## Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

### Description

In this task, you are given a main file that contains a piece of code causing an infinite loop. Your task is to comment out the code that leads to the infinite loop while keeping the original structure of the program intact. The goal is to prevent the program from entering the infinite loop, as shown in the provided output.

### Files

- `1-main.c`: The main file with the code that causes an infinite loop.

## Task 2: 0 > 972?

### Description

This task involves a program that is supposed to print the largest of three integers. However, the provided code doesn't produce the correct output for the given test case. Your job is to fix the code in the `2-largest_number.c` file to ensure that it correctly determines and prints the largest number among the three integers.

### Files

- `2-main.c`: The main file that tests the `largest_number` function.
- `2-largest_number.c`: The file containing the `largest_number` function.

## Task 3: Leap year

### Description

In this task, you have a program that converts a date to the day of the year and calculates how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into account. The provided code doesn't handle leap years correctly. Your task is to fix the `3-print_remaining_days.c` file to ensure that it correctly calculates and prints the day of the year and the remaining days for various dates and leap years.

### Files

- `3-main_a.c`: The main file that tests date calculations for non-leap years.
- `3-convert_day.c`: The file containing the `convert_day` function for day conversion.
- `3-print_remaining_days.c`: The file containing the `print_remaining_days` function for printing results.
