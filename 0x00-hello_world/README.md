# C Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programs and scripts for various tasks. Each task is contained in its own file, and here's a brief overview of each task and how to run the code:

## Task 0: Preprocessor
- Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- Usage: `./0-preprocessor`

## Task 1: Compiler
- Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- Usage: `./1-compiler`

## Task 2: Assembler
- Script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
- Usage: `./2-assembler`

## Task 3: Name
- Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- Usage: `./3-name`

## Task 4: Hello, puts
- C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.
- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 4-puts.c`

## Task 5: Hello, printf
- C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the `printf` function.
- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 5-printf.c`

## Task 6: Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
- C program that prints the sizes of various data types on the system.
- Compilation for 32-bit: `gcc 6-size.c -m32 -o size32`
- Compilation for 64-bit: `gcc 6-size.c -m64 -o size64`

## Task 7: Intel
- Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
- Usage: `./100-intel`

## Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
- C program that prints a specific message to the standard error output.
- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o quote 101-quote.c`

These C programs and scripts were created by Julien Barbier for ALX-Holberton School.
