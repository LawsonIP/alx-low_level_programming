# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops.

## 0. _putchar
- A C program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
- The program should return 0.

[0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c)

## 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- A C function `print_alphabet` that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- It uses the `_putchar` function and is limited to using `_putchar` twice in the code.

[1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c)

## 2. 10 x alphabet
- A C function `print_alphabet_x10` that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line.
- It uses the `_putchar` function and is limited to using `_putchar` twice in the code.

[2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)

## 3. islower
- A C function `_islower` that checks if a character is a lowercase letter.
- It returns 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 otherwise.

[3-islower.c](./3-islower.c)

## 4. isalpha
- A C function `_isalpha` that checks if a character is an alphabetic character (either lowercase or uppercase).
- It returns 1 if the character is alphabetic and 0 otherwise.

[4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c)

## 5. Sign
- A C function `print_sign` that prints the sign of a number.
- It returns 1 and prints '+' if the number is greater than zero, 0 and prints '0' if the number is zero, and -1 and prints '-' if the number is less than zero.

[5-sign.c](./5-sign.c)

## 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
- A C function `_abs` that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- It returns the absolute value of the input integer.

[6-abs.c](./6-abs.c)

## 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
- A C function `print_last_digit` that prints the last digit of a number.
- It returns the value of the last digit.

[7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c)

## 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
- A C function `jack_bauer` that prints every minute of the day in the format HH:MM, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

[8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c)

## 9. Learn your times table
- A C function `times_table` that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0, in a well-formatted manner.

[9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c)

## 10. a + b
- A C function `add` that adds two integers and returns the result.

[10-add.c](./10-add.c)

## 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
- A C function `print_to_98` that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98 in the format "n, n+1, n+2, ..., 98."

[11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c)

## 12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself
- A C function `print_times_table` that prints the times table up to the given number n.
- If n is greater than 15 or less than 0, it should not print anything.

[100-times_table.c](./100-times_table.c)

## 13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
- A C program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

[101-natural.c](./101-natural.c)

## 14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A
- A C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.

[102-fibonacci.c](./102-fibonacci.c)

## 15. Even Liber Abbaci
- A C program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000.

[103-fibonacci.c](./103-fibonacci.c)
