# ALX Low-Level Programming - Variables, If-Else, While

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the "Variables, If-Else, While" project. In this project, you will find C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while).

## 0. Positive Anything Is Better Than Negative Nothing

- File: `0-positive_or_negative.c`
- Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

## 1. The Last Digit

- File: `1-last_digit.c`
- Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It prints the last digit of the number stored in `n` along with whether it's greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

## 2. I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia...

- File: `2-print_alphabet.c`
- Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` twice.

## 3. alphABET

- File: `3-print_alphabets.c`
- Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet, all in a single line. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` three times.

## 4. When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup...

- File: `4-print_alphabt.c`
- Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet while omitting the letters 'q' and 'e'. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` twice.

## 5. Numbers

- File: `5-print_numbers.c`
- Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, from 0 to 9, in a single line.

## 6. Numberz

- File: `6-print_numberz.c`
- Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, from 0 to 9, in a single line. It does not use variables of type `char` and can only use the `putchar` function twice.

## 7. Smile in the Mirror

- File: `7-print_tebahpla.c`
- Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, from 'z' to 'a', all in a single line. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` twice.

## 8. Hexadecimal

- File: `8-print_base16.c`
- Description: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, from 0 to 15, in a single line. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` three times.

## 9. Patience, Persistence and Perspiration Make an Unbeatable Combination for Success

- File: `9-print_comb.c`
- Description: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space. Numbers are printed in ascending order. It uses the `putchar` function and can only use `putchar` four times.

## 10. Inventing is a Combination of Brains and Materials

- File: `100-print_comb3.c`
- Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, ranging from 0 to 9. Combinations are separated by a comma and a space. It prints only the smallest combination of two digits and numbers are printed in ascending order.

## 11. The Success Combination in Business Is...

- File: `101-print_comb4.c`
- Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits, ranging from 0 to 9. Combinations are separated by a comma and a space. It prints only the smallest combination of three digits and numbers are printed in ascending order.

## 12. Software Is Eating the World

- File: `102-print_comb5.c`
- Description: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, ranging from 0 to 99. Combinations are separated by a space. All numbers are printed with two digits, and the combinations are separated by a comma and a space.

Each program is thoroughly documented and adheres to coding standards. It provides examples of various concepts related to variables, conditional statements, loops, and output using the `putchar` function.
